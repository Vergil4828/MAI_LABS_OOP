# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "master" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]


# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build-and-test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:

      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
     

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: |
          docker build -t apptest .devcontainer/

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          docker run --rm apptest /bin/bash -c "
            mkdir -p build &&
            cd build &&
            cmake .. &&
            make &&
            ./tests
